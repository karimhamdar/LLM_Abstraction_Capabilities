# Comparing Humans, GPT-4, and Claude 2 on Abstraction and Reasoning Tasks

## Project
This study investigates the abstract reasoning capabilities of large pre-trained language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and Claude 2, using the ConceptARC dataset composed by a series of visual and analogical reasoning tasks designed to assess general abstract reasoning capabilities. We utilize enhanced prompts to investigate their impact on model performance.
